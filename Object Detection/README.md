## Object Detection using Arduino 
How it works:
1. The ultrasonic sensor measures distance.

2. If the object is closer than 30 cm, the buzzer sounds and the LED turns on.

3. Otherwise, both are turned off.


**Components used:**
1. LED - Red
2. Resistor - 220 ohms
3. Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - HC SRO4
4. Arduino UNO
5. Piezoelectric Buzzer
